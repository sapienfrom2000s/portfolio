Earlier there were Dev team and Ops Team. The job of Dev team was to make sure that coding part is done. The role of Ops team was to make sure that the release is stable.

Parameter of success for Devs was - Number of features built
Parameter of success for Ops was - Number of stable releases

Both of them worked separately. Devs didn't care what ops was doing and vice versa. This created a lot of friction bw the two. Also, lot of process in Ops team was manual.

Enter Devops. It is a methodology that ensures that lifecycle of a software is as smooth as possible. Remember the infinity Diagram.

- **Plan** – Define goals, requirements, and features.
- **Code** – Develop and version control the code.
- **Build** – Compile and package into deployable artifacts.
- **Test** – Run automated tests to ensure quality.
- **Release** – Prepare code for deployment.
- **Deploy** – Push to production or staging.
- **Operate** – Run applications and maintain infrastructure.
- **Monitor** – Track performance, logs, and incidents

Devops engineers are the ones who ensure that the software is delivered to the user smoothly. They get involved in the software lifecycle from planning phase and make changes in the infra accordingly.Earlier there were Dev team and Ops Team.
