# DNS Lookup Flow (Example)

## Step 1: Browser Request

You type `www.example.com` in your browser.

## Step 2: OS and Resolver

The browser asks your OS, and the OS asks a DNS resolver (e.g., `1.1.1.1`).

## Step 3: Root Servers

Resolver checks cache → miss → asks root servers:  
"Who handles `.com`?"

Root replies: "Ask `.com` TLD servers."

## Step 4: TLD Servers

Resolver asks `.com` TLD servers:  
"Who is authoritative for `example.com`?"

TLD replies: "`example.com` → `ns-123.awsdns-45.net`"

## Step 5: Authoritative Server

Resolver asks the authoritative server:  
"What is `www.example.com`?"

Authoritative server replies: "`www.example.com` → `203.0.113.10`"

## Step 6: Cache and Connect

Resolver caches the answer, returns the IP to the OS → browser connects to `203.0.113.10`.

Connection is established → page loads.
