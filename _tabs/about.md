Iâ€™m Shivam, a backend developer with 1.5 year of experience working with Ruby on Rails, Docker, and Kubernetes. I build and maintain server-side applications, work with APIs and databases, and explore infrastructure tools to improve deployment and scalability.

I learned coding through The Odin Project and continue to expand my skills by experimenting with new technologies and building projects. This blog is where I document solutions, share code examples, and record what I learn from day-to-day development work.
